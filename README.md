## Q1: 
> Write a Java program with a method named 'totalSum' that takes in an argument of two integers and return its sum. Call this method from main( ) and print the results.





>Ans: 
public class method {
	
	public static void totalSum(int A,int B) {
		int C=0;
		C=A+B;
		System.out.println("The total sum of "+A+" and "+B+" is " +C);

	}


	public static void main(String[] args) {
		totalSum(12, 12);

	}

}


## Q2:
> Write a Java program with a method named 'getGrades' that will display grades according to the marks entered into the method call as below:
```
Marks        Grade
91-100         A+
81-90          A-
71-80          B+
61-70          B-
51-60          C+
41-50          D-
<=40          Fail
```

## Q3:
> Write a program to print the factorial of a number by defining a method named 'factorial'. Factorial of any number n is represented by n! and is equal to 1*2*3*....
``` 
4! = 1*2*3*4 = 24
3! = 3*2*1 = 6
2! = 2*1 = 2
Also,
1! = 1
0! = 0
```
